  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I have worked in the Software Engineering industry for 20+ years in many kinds of roles and using many
    different technologies. I am extremely adaptable and have been relied upon to pick up new technologies/languages on
    an as-needed basis. I am used to working in a team as well as on solo projects and tasks.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Employment History</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2001-present: Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.commscope.com/">CommScope</a> (formerly <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_plc">Pace MicroTechnology</a>/ Latens Ltd / <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arris_International">ARRIS</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I joined CommScope (then Pace Microtechnology) from university as a member of the hardware team working on
    broadband wireless solutions however that quickly developed into software engineering. My role has evolved over the
    past 20+ years, particularly in light of internal career moves to the security business (Latens) and the company's
    acquisition by ARRIS Inc and then CommScope.</p>
  <p>
    I worked for a few years on embedded software (ASSEMBLY/C) in a development role, bringing new products to the
    market and supporting them in manufacturing and in the field during the immediate post launch period.
    Thereafter, I moved into a predominantly maintenance role supporting a wide range of hardware platforms and software
    architectures for many different markets worldwide. This included bug fixing but also involved developing new
    features to increase their lifespan.</p>
  <p>
    In late 2012, I moved to the Latens division of the company to work on Linux based server applications
    (C/C++/Java/SQL/Redis) for Digital Rights Management (DRM).</p>
  <p>
    In 2019, ARRIS was acquired by CommScope and I moved to working on web applications (Typescript/Angular/Docker) for
    managing Hybrid Fibre and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network">Passive Optical
      Network</a> (PON) devices.
    My day to day work covers software/component design, coding, testing and integration with back-end services/APIs. I
    work as part of a small team of engineers with similarly diverse skills where my work ranges from solo projects
    and features to intra and inter-team collaborations with a wider scope. I carry out peer code reviews and learning
    mentoring for others.</p>
