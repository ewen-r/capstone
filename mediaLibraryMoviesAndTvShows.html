        "2001" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a
        monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to
        reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that
        humankind has evolved that far. Now mankind, assisted by artificial intelligence (such as HAL), must dare to
        encounter the monolith placers. If successful we will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.
